# AIMS Data Science Hackathon by Microsoft

## About the Problem

Granular information on economic well being is extremely useful for governments and policy makers. But household surveys that capture this kind of information are expensive and conducted infrequently in many African countries. For this competition we will attempt to create a workaround for this lack of data by building a model able to predict a measure of wealth as measured in household surveys using readily available inputs.

Using data from 18 different countries collected at different times, you must correctly predict the cluster-level estimated wealth measures found from surveys in 7 different countries not covered in the training data. A successful model could be useful for filling in the gaps between the more expensive surveys.

## About AIMS Data Science Hackathon

The AIMS Data Science Hackathon will run from 25 January to 28 February 2021, however students can register here at any time. Students from AIMS campuses across the continent are invited to come together on the virtual Zindi platform to develop machine learning and AI solutions to solve a real-world problem.

We strongly recommend that AIMS students prepare over the break (December to January) by completing the LinkedIn/Microsoft Data Analyst course, which will get you familiar with basic data analysis and exploration. Microsoft will offer the top 100 students in the hackathon vouchers to take the exam to become a certified Microsoft Data Analyst Associate.

So get your secret code from your university and sign-up today. Check out the LinkedIn Learning Data Analyst course here to sharpen your data skills over the holidays. The data will be posted and the competition will go live on 25 January 2021!

## About the AIMS Data Science Hackathon

The AIMS Data Science Hackathon is a completely virtual hackathon. Students can work in teams of up to four people. The problem, dataset, discussion forum, and leaderboard will be open and available on the Zindi platform for the duration of the hackathon and students are welcome to work on the problem at their own pace.

Students will be challenged to build a machine learning model to solve a real world problem that affects Africa. The challenge will be accessible to beginners, but students will need some experience programming in R or Python.
